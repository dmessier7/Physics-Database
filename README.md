# Physics-Database
Database Program for Physics and Engineering Inventory

Objective: An interface for use by the lab techs and lab assistants to keep track of inventory, see the items required for lab set ups, and help ensure there's enough of what's need for set ups. At first this will be localized to one computer, but hopefully eventually we can connect it to the lab's cloud file storage to allow multiple computers to use and edit the system.

The progam will be written in python, using the sqlite library to create, manage, and pull from the database(s). What will be used for the GUI isn't super concrete. Right now I'm using PyQt5 which isn't amazing, so something else might work better. tKinter wasn't used because of limitations on the placement and style.
